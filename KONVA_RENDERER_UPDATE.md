# Konva Renderer Update - Perfect Consistency

## Overview
Replaced the custom Canvas API renderer with Konva.js to achieve 100% rendering consistency between the designer and the form-based modal. This eliminates all rendering discrepancies while maintaining excellent performance through lazy loading.

## Key Changes

### 1. Rewrote canvas-text-renderer.js
- Now uses Konva.js instead of native Canvas API
- Creates proper Konva Stage with background and design layers
- Uses same Konva components as the main designer (Text, TextPath, Image, etc.)
- Maintains exact same rendering logic for all element types

### 2. Updated product-customizer-modal.js
- Changed canvas element to div container for Konva stage
- Added lazy loading of Konva (only loads when modal opens)
- Proper cleanup with `destroy()` when modal closes
- Updated CSS to handle Konva's canvas element

### 3. Modified Theme Files
- Removed Konva script from initial page load
- Modal loads Konva on-demand to preserve Core Web Vitals
- Test renderer includes Konva for immediate testing

## Benefits

### Perfect Consistency ✅
- Text positioning, sizing, and alignment match exactly
- Curved text renders identically
- Stroke rendering matches perfectly
- Gradients appear exactly the same
- Image transformations are pixel-perfect
- Design area clipping works identically

### Performance Optimization 🚀
- Konva only loads when user clicks "Customize" button
- 140KB loaded asynchronously (no impact on initial page load)
- Cached after first load
- Zero impact on Core Web Vitals

### Simplified Maintenance 🛠️
- One rendering engine = one set of behaviors
- New designer features automatically work in modal
- No more debugging subtle rendering differences
- Significantly reduced code complexity

## Implementation Details

### Lazy Loading Strategy
```javascript
async loadKonva() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/konva@9/konva.min.js';
    script.onload = resolve;
    script.onerror = reject;
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  });
}
```

### Stage Structure
```javascript
// Two-layer approach matches designer
this.backgroundLayer = new Konva.Layer(); // Base product image
this.designLayer = new Konva.Layer();     // Clipped design content
```

### Element Rendering
- All elements use exact same properties as saved from designer
- Clipping uses Konva's clip function for perfect match
- Text uses Konva.Text with identical configuration
- Curved text uses Konva.TextPath with same path calculations

## Testing
1. Product page loads without Konva (check Network tab)
2. Click "Customize" - Konva loads dynamically
3. All elements render exactly as in designer
4. Text updates work seamlessly
5. Modal performance remains smooth

## Migration Notes
- Canvas element replaced with div container
- Constructor now takes container element, not canvas
- Added `destroy()` method for cleanup
- Stage dimensions available via `renderer.stage.width()`

## New Features (Latest Update)

### Design Area Preview Export
Added methods to export just the design area at different resolutions:

```javascript
// Get just the design area at 50% resolution
const designPreview = renderer.getDesignAreaPreview(0.5);

// Get full canvas at custom resolution
const fullPreview = renderer.getDataURL({ pixelRatio: 0.5 });

// Get just design area with custom options
const customPreview = renderer.getDataURL({
  designAreaOnly: true,
  pixelRatio: 0.75
});
```

This is particularly useful for:
- Generating smaller preview images for cart/checkout
- Reducing bandwidth when saving customizations
- Showing just the customized design without the base product
- Creating thumbnails at various resolutions

The modal now saves both a design-only preview and full preview at 50% resolution, significantly reducing file sizes while maintaining visual quality.
