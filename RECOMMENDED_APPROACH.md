## Shopify App Proxy with Fully Hydrating Remix Routes

### Overview
The app proxy setup enables a fully hydrating Remix app to work through Shopify's proxy system. This allows customers to access the designer at URLs like `https://your-store.myshopify.com/apps/designer/designer` with full JavaScript hydration.

### Implementation

1. **Route Naming Convention**
   - Proxy routes must follow the pattern: `apps.{subpath}.{route}.tsx`
   - For proxy at `/apps/designer`, use `apps.designer.designer.tsx`

2. **Vite Configuration**
   - Development proxy settings rewrite paths correctly
   - Production assets use proxy-compatible paths
   - Base URL set to SHOPIFY_APP_URL for correct asset loading

3. **Production Deployment**
   For production, you'll need a custom Express server to handle proxy routing:
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   import express from "express";
   import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'http-proxy-middleware';
   import { createRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/express";
   
   const app = express();
   
   // Proxy middleware for production
   app.use(
     '/designer',
     createProxyMiddleware({
       target: process.env.SHOPIFY_APP_URL + '/apps/designer/designer',
       changeOrigin: true,
     })
   );
   
   // Serve Remix app
   app.all("*", remixHandler);
   ```

### Key Benefits
- Full JavaScript hydration through app proxy
- Seamless integration with Shopify storefront
- Consistent asset loading in dev and production
- No manual URL rewriting needed
